    <h2>Google Ads</h2><br>
    <p>
        Google Ads, formerly known as Google AdWords, is an advertising platform that allows businesses to display ads to internet users based on their search queries and other factors. The ads are displayed on Google's search engine results pages (SERP), websites, and other apps through Google's ad network.

        Here's how Google Ads works:
        
        Advertisers create ads: Advertisers create text, display, video, and other types of ads to promote their products or services.
        
        Keyword targeting: Advertisers choose keywords that are relevant to their products or services and target their ads to show up when users search for those keywords on Google.
        
        Bidding: Advertisers bid on keywords to determine the maximum amount they're willing to pay for each click on their ad. The highest bidder for a keyword is more likely to have their ad displayed in the top position.
        
        Ad auction: Google runs an auction for each search query to determine which ads to display and in what order. The auction takes into account the bid amount, the relevance and quality of the ad, and the advertiser's expected click-through rate (CTR).
        
        Ad display: The winning ads are displayed on the SERP, websites, and other apps through Google's ad network.
        
        Charging: Advertisers are charged when a user clicks on their ad, based on the cost-per-click (CPC) they bid for the keyword.
        
        By targeting the right keywords, creating high-quality ads, and optimizing their bids and ad spend, businesses can reach a large audience and drive more traffic to their website through Google Ads.
